# Password Generator

This repository contains a Java-based Password Generator application that allows users to create secure passwords tailored to their preferences. It offers a simple command-line interface for generating passwords and checking their strength.

## Features

- *Customizable Password Generation*: Users can specify the types of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) and the length of the password.
- *Password Strength Checking*: The application evaluates the strength of passwords based on criteria such as length, character types, and complexity.
- *Useful Information*: Provides guidelines and tips for creating strong passwords, including avoiding common pitfalls and weak password patterns.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone  https://github.com/Ruthik005/Password-Generator-master.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   bash
   cd Password-Generator
   

3. Compile the project:

   bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java

   To run the application in Visual Studio Code, use the shortcut Ctrl+F5.

### Usage

1. Run the project:

   bash
   java -cp bin Main
   
2. Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to customize the password generation options.
3. After generating a password, the application will provide feedback on its strength and suggest improvements if necessary.
4. Users can also access useful information on creating strong passwords by selecting the appropriate menu option.

## Design Choices

- *Modular Design*: The application is divided into separate classes for alphabet generation, password generation, password strength evaluation, and user interaction.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: The command-line interface provides clear instructions and feedback to guide users through the password generation process.
- *Error Handling*: Implemented error handling mechanisms to address incorrect user input and provide helpful error messages.
- *Randomization*: Ensured randomness in password generation to enhance security and prevent predictability.

## Challenges Faced

- *User Input Validation*: Ensuring that user input is properly validated and handled to prevent runtime errors and unexpected behavior.
- *Algorithm Complexity*: Balancing between generating secure passwords and ensuring efficient performance, especially for longer passwords.
- *Feedback Mechanism*: Designing a robust feedback system to provide users with meaningful insights into their generated passwords' strength and potential weaknesses.
- •	Handling User Input: One challenge faced during implementation was handling user input in a robust manner. The application needed to validate user responses to ensure they were in the expected format (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). This required implementing error-checking mechanisms and providing clear instructions to the user.
•	Testing: Another challenge was writing comprehensive test cases to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality. This involved testing various scenarios such as different combinations of character types and password lengths. Additionally, integrating JUnit for testing required understanding and configuring the testing framework correctly.

##DOCUMENTATION

Password Generator Implementation
The Password Generator is a Java application designed to generate secure passwords based on user preferences. It offers a command-line interface where users can specify the types of characters they want in their passwords and their length. Additionally, it provides functionality to check the strength of a given password.
Classes Overview:
1.	Alphabet: This class defines the character sets from which passwords can be generated. It provides options for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The getAlphabet() method returns the concatenated character set based on user preferences.
2.	Password: The Password class represents a password string. It includes methods to calculate the strength of the password based on various criteria such as length, character types, and complexity.
3.	Generator: This class serves as the main controller of the application. It interacts with the user through the command-line interface, generates passwords based on user input, and checks the strength of passwords. It utilizes instances of the Alphabet and Password classes to perform these operations.
Design Choices:
•	Alphabet Class: The Alphabet class was designed to encapsulate the logic for generating character sets. By providing a flexible constructor that accepts parameters for including different types of characters, it allows for easy customization of character sets based on user preferences.
•	Password Class: The Password class was designed to encapsulate the logic for password strength calculation. It uses simple heuristics such as password length and the presence of different character types to determine the strength of a password.
•	Generator Class: The Generator class serves as the main entry point of the application. It provides methods for generating passwords and checking their strength. It also handles user input and output through the command-line interface.
The Password Generator application provides a simple yet effective solution for generating secure passwords tailored to user preferences. By allowing users to specify the types of characters and the length of passwords, it offers flexibility and customization. Through robust design choices and thorough testing, the application ensures reliability and security in generating passwords.
